<p>Go to Mussoorie and ask a local the address of Savoy Hotel and you can immediately see the fear in the eyes of the stranger! It is probably one of the most haunted places in Mussoorie that guards some serious secrets in its old walls. So back in 1911, Lady Garnet Orme, a well-known British spiritualist was murdered here. Apparently, she was poisoned with strychnine and suffered a painful slow death.</p>
<p>A few years later, her doctor was murdered too in the same manner and still nobody knows the killer. The mystery remains unsolved and it is believed that the lady lurks in the corridors of the hotel still looking for her murderer. A number of guests have reported incidents such as doors shutting on their own, unknown whispers, and some people also say that they have seen Lady Orme herself.</p>

<p>Pari Tibba or Hill of Fairies is quite an infamous spot in Mussoorie and for obvious reasons. The place finds its mention in several Ruskin Bond books. </p>
<p>Located close to the renowned Woodstock School, the hill is for some unexplained reasons quite prone to lightning strikes and paranormal activities. Locals tell a tale of two lovers who died right inside the woods of the hills, and now they haunt the place. It is not advised to go inside the woods after the sun goes down.</p>
